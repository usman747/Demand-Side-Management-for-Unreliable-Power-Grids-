Metric testing was not sucessful. The planner POPF-TIF (POPF2) does not get effected by using the "metric" keyword. It follows
the goal, it sees or runs the actions which can lead it to the goal earlier.

The planner runs the action LOW as its written above LOWEST action. If I move LOWEST up then it runs, so it gets the action 
by line-by-line execution. 

Although, if and when I changed the temperature decrease effect. Say LOW decreased 5 and LOWEST 6, then the planner ran LOWEST action.
As this action will get it to the goal more quickly. So this is how this planner works. And the "metric" directive with goal doesn't work.
 
Even it doesn't work on the implicitly defined "total-time" function/fluent. I tried.
